CSS and Typography
 
.lorem.text2 - search the both classes in a single element
.lorem .text2 - search for nested .text2 in .lorem
 
The selector with more classes is stronger. 
If there are two selectors with the same classes the browser uses the last (latest). It reads line by line. Inspection tool works different. It shows first the active selectors.
 
The specificity is ordering selectors by style attribute, id, class and pseudo-lass (hover, active, visible, etc.), elements (p,h1,etc)
 
ul#nav li.active a
 ul has nav in it 
inside the ul is li with class active
inside there is a
113 points selector
 
body.ie7 .col_3 h2 h2
0023 points selector
 
li style=color:red 
1000 points selector - inline stylization is very hard to be overwritten.
 
If we write !important after the stylization - it takes 100000 points, but it is not a good practice to use it too often.  text-align: center !important;
 
 
.unordered > .lorem - searching for directed children class
.unordered .lorem - all children
 
When two selectors are with equal points - we use the latest- overwrite
 
It matters what the order of the stylesheets in the head is!
 
@font-face {
    font-family: "NameOfImported";      -what we write in ex.: p {font-family: "NameOfImported"}
    src: url('fonts/NameOfImported')}
-we are registering the font for our browser
 
em - relative to original size
px - relative to smth
 
When nesting with em - the parent is 1,2, the children is 1,2 * 1,2, the next children - 1,2*1,2*1,2; better to use rem - the base rem works with is the html tag: html {font-size: 8px}
 
font-weight - bolding; bold tag is 700 
font-style - oblique, italic, normal
text-align - center, left (default), right, justify
text-decoration: line-through, text-indent
text-overflow: clip, ellipsis (if the container is broken we get ...)
white-space: break-spaces, unset, nowrap (break the container)
overflow: scroll, hidden (to get ...) - controlling what happens to the content which is too wide
text-transform: uppercase, capitalize, lowercase 
word-break- break-all, keep-all(normal) - how to enter new line
background-color
cursor: cell, copy, grab, pointer, etc.
outline: 50px solid red
letter-spacing: 2px
line-height: 30 - can work without values(px)

font-awesome cdnjs - free links 
 
@import (at rule, for css for importing urls) "link" in css and link tag to the css in the head with link tag
or
adding external library to the head directly with link tag- better control
 
@import url("link")
 
hover - when we put the cursor over an element
